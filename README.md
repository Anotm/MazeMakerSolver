<br />
Input the following parameters and then click generate to make your maze. <br />
<br />
-Delay: How slowly you want the program to run in milliseconds. (See the cool squares change colors and all)<br />
-Grid Width: How many squares in width you want the maze to be. Only creating square mazes.<br />
-Cell Width: How big each cell will be in pixels.<br />
-Border Width: How thick the walls will be.<br />
<br />
When maze has generated, you can click on the cell to highlight it blue. Using this you can try and solve it!<br />
<br />
The next step from here is to work on more algorithms that generate a maze and solve the maze.<br />

For now i dont have a website/location where I can display the project. You can download it and open the file named "index.html". You will also see a "run.bat" file; I used this to create a "localhost" and run the project through there. This only works if you have windows, python 3 installed and set to be alias of python, and SimmplHTTP installed. (I'd just recommend you open the "index.html"...it'll be easier)
