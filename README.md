Input the following parameters and then click generate to make your maze. <br /> <br />

-Delay: How slowly you want the program to run in milliseconds. (See the cool squares change colors and all)<br />
-Grid Width: How many squares in width you want the maze to be. Only creating square mazes.<br />
-Cell Width: How big each cell will be in pixels.<br />
-Border Width: How thick the walls will be.<br /><br />

There is a bug (explained on the page) but it looks kinda cool so i didnt fix it.<br />
