Input the following parameters and then click generate to make your maze.
-Delay: How slowly you want the program to run in milliseconds. (See the cool squares change colors and all)
-Grid Width: How many squares in width you want the maze to be. Only creating square mazes.
-Cell Width: How big each cell will be in pixels.
-Border Width: How thick the walls will be.

There is a bug (explained on the page) but it looks kinda cool so i didnt fix it.
